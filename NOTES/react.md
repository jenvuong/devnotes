Everything I have learnt so far in React!

## useState
useState is a React Hook that allows you to create a state variable.

### Import using
`import { useState } from "react";`

### Initializing
Initialize the state at the top of the function.  
`const [count, setCount] = useState("")`  

The first value, `count` represents the name of the state.  
The second value, `setCount` represents the name of the function that updates the state.  
The third value, `""` inside the round brackets sets the initial state. In this case, the initial state is set to an empty string.
