## Command Line

### What is Command Line?
Command line interface (CLI) is the interface in which we enter commands as text inputs, which allow the computer to execute tasks.
It is the 'alternative' to Graphical user interface (GUI). This is essentially the interface or the things on the screen that we can see and click to perform tasks on the computer.

#### Why not just use the GUI?
Why do we need to learn CLI if we can do the same tasks using the GUI?  
CLI can help us perform tasks more efficiently. Doing the same set of tasks through the GUI may require numerous clicks and sorting through crowds of windows.  
With CLI, a task can be executed with writing just a single line of code. With effort and habit in employing the Command Line, it will eventually become muscle-memory and improve our workflow.


### What is the Terminal?
The terminal is a text input and output environment. More simply put, it is the 'window' where we enter text inputs as commands.  

### What is a Shell?
A shell is a program that provides a user interface which handles inputs (commands) and outputs accordingly. A shell is the layer between the user and kernel. It acts as an interpreter which allows users to interact with the kernel from the command line.

#### Bash
Bash (Bourne-Again SHell) is the most widely used shell program.
