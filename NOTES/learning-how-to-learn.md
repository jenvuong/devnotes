# Learning How To Learn

## Basis
This document will be a compilation of lessons I have learnt from various sources about learning how to learn. The decision to start building out this document now is with the intention of further immersing myself into the world of programming. Learning how to learn is a crucial skill lifelong skill for good programmers, so building and maintaining an active learning approach to *any* skill in life as a matter of fact, is a worthwhile skill to learn. 


## Lessons

### 1. Learn enough to start playing.
When approaching a new topic, it is quite tempting to search for that 'perfect' resource that contains all the information we need to know about the subject. It seems to make us feel more at ease knowing that there is a perfectly outlined path to conquering all the knowledge we need to know about a topic.  

However, doing so often slows down our learning process. One common approach to learning a new topic, is to tread through all the content — by reading, listening or watching — from the beginning to end. It is then a mission to recall what we have learnt at different stages as we go about trying to apply what we've learnt. We often find ourselves continuously going back to relearn what we had previously 'learnt'.  

A more effective approach could be to gain just enough knowledge about a subject to start playing around. This trigger our experimental and exploration frame of mind. When we know just enough to be able to experiment, we are allowing ourselves to explore on our own accord and most importantly, make our **own** discoveries. This is a significant ability to tap into, as through self-guided play and exploration, we will naturally develop our **own** questions and curiosities about a topic.  
Once we are done playing/exploring to the extent of our limited knowledge, it is a good time to go back to material to find answers to our questions. We will have a comparatively greater interest to the answers of these questions, as we have formed them through our own experimentation and experience. The answers to these questions now have **purpose and value**, which increases the likelihood of the information retaining in our minds. 

This is a great first lesson in learning how to learn. However, there is one important factor in order for this learning approach to happen. It is the ability to be at ease with not knowing. It is necessary to allow ourselves to try, encounter problems, try again and still not know. This is what it really means to experiment. So it is crucial to be comfortable in the state of not knowing, as it is exactly the environment where we are able to develop questions that are meaningful to us. Thus, giving the answer more value, and the purpose of seeking knowledge some meaning.

>"Become at ease with the state of 'not knowing'. This takes you beyond the mind because the mind is always trying to conclude and interpret. It is afraid of not knowing. So, when you can be at ease with not knowing, you have already gone beyond the mind. A deeper knowing that is non-conceptual then arises out of that state."
